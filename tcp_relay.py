"""
This is a simple TCP server that passes data between a Python script and an Unreal Engine 5 Runtime.
It runs in a separate thread so communication is not affected by the main script or UE execution time.

*Requires the TCP Socket Plugin from SpartanCode to be installed and enabled in Unreal Engine and used in a customized TCP actor blueprint

 - Github: https://github.com/CodeSpartan/UE4TcpSocketPlugin

Steps:
1. Start a script containing the TCP_Relay class
2. Launch Unreal Engine 5 Runtime (ie Play in Editor)
3. Unreal Engine will connect to the TCP relay server ("Connected" will be printed in the console)
4. TCP Relay will immediately start sending its default .message data to Unreal Engine
5. To change outgoing data, main script sets the TCP_Relay.message variable, ie .message = create_fields_string([1., 2., 3.])
6. The TCP_Relay and UE TCP actor will exchange data as the main script runs
7. Main script is responsible for decoding/parsing data returned from UE via the .message_in attribute
7. TCP Relay should continue running even if UE runtime ends ("Disconnected" will be printed in the console), allowing new connections

Notes:
- The TCP Socket Plugin must be installed and enabled in Unreal Engine.
- The TCP Socket Plugin must be configured to use the same host and port as the TCP relay server.
- The TCP Socket Plugin must be configured to use the same number of fields as the TCP relay server.
- The TCP relay server will send the message string to Unreal Engine every 4ms.
- Message size should have plenty of overhead to account for the size of the fields and any additional data, but adjust as needed.
- Not tested in Unreal Engine 4, but the SpartanCode page indicates it should work.
