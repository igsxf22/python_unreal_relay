Hello

This project provides a simple way to exchange real-time data from a python script to an Unreal Engine 5 runtime

This can be used to control UE5 actors, characters, and environments with simple data from Python
    - Example: using ArduPilot SITL to control the location and orientation of an actor in UE5

...and to receive feedback from interactions with the UE5 environment
    - Example: Add context to the SITL world by simulating a lidar height sensor
